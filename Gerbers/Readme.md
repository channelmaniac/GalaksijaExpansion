These are the gerbers for the expansion interface adapter card. 

I used JLCPCB for these and they contacted me with questions during the PCB build. I removed the silkscreen
from the vias so the PCB could be soldered into place but did not remove the silkscreen from the 2 larger
mounting holes. They thought that was odd so asked me if I wanted to remove the silkscreen from those too 
or to honor the file. I replied with a polite thank you and that it didn't matter on those as they were
mounting holes and not soldered connections and to honor the file.

First time they ever contacted me about a PCB build. It's nice that they are helpful in that way.
